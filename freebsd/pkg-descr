This is a program I wrote for cancer researchers and others who want to use
Multiplex PCR to study DNA samples, and wish to optimise their combinations of
primers to minimise the formation of dimers.

Primer Pooler can:

* Check through each proposed pool for combinations that are likely to form
  dimers,

* Automatically move prospective amplicons between proposed pools to reduce
  dimer formation,

* Automatically search the genome sequence to find which amplicons overlap, and
  place their corresponding primers in separate pools,

* Optionally keep pool sizes within a specified range,

* Handle thousands of primers without being slow (useful for high-throughput
  sequencing applications),

* Do all of the above with degenerate primers too.

If your CPU is modern enough to have them, Primer Pooler will take advantage of
64-bit registers and multiple cores. But it also runs on older equipment.
