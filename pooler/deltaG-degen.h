     rounding error shouldn't matter as long as we
     take the EXACT same steps for both calculations
     (rouding errors should be exactly identical).
     In practice, when compiling with optimisation,
     some of GCC's optimisations result in floating-
     point calculations becoming slightly different
     in different places (reordering etc), and it's
     NOT guaranteed that you'll get the exact same
     bits from two different parts of the program
     that seemingly do the same thing!  So we have
     to do the "nearly equal" thing.

     are very small <0 deltaG's (but those are not
     likely to be accurate anyway: take them out?
     insist on a threshold of at least -1 ?) could
     adapt the 0.001 but beware of slowing it down
     (if b is a min, try b += fabs(b)*0.0001 before
     the loop)
